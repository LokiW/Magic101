    On the outside of the scroll, your name is written in big loopy ink. When you open it, the scroll unfurls down to your waist. There is a thud as something falls out of the scroll to the ground. It is a heavy silver coin with a hole in the center and strange runes carved roughly around the edge. The scroll reads, in big loopy writting hand inked onto the thick paper -\n

    You gather up what you hope will be enough money for your school supplies and make your way towards a fountain. It is not labeled as a wishing well but there are a few coins scattered around the bottom of the pool. You take the heavy silver coin and toss it into the well wishing to arrive at the magical marketplace. The water in the fountain suddenly stops in place. It isn't frozen like ice, but the water is suspended in the air, unmoving. The drops of water that splashed out from where the fountain hit the pool are suspended in place. Looking around everything is frozen. The birds still in the sky above you, the leaves of a nearby tree bent mid breeze but unmoving. Then the pool of the fountain begins to spin and the water emits a strange glowing light. You step over the edge of the fountain into the water which parts out of the way of your feet. The glowing water then rises slowly around you, forming a whirling column of glowing water obstructing the world from view. 

    With a sudden splash, the water falls back to the ground but as you look around, you are no longer next to the fountain where you threw the coin.

  description: "You think you recall the location of a fountain, and you gather the coin and scroll and make your way towards it. It is not labeled as a wishing well but there are a few coins scattered around the bottom of the pool. You take the heavy silver coin, and feeling a bit foolish, toss it into the water. Supposing you are supposed to make a wish, you wish that magic was real, then feeling foolish you turn to scurry away from the fountain before you can be disapointed. As you turn, however, you notice something odd. The gentle summer breeze had suddenly died, but the nearby tree is still bent at an odd angle as if being blown. Except all the leaves are perfectly and unnaturally still. There is a bird that had just jumped from it's branches band although it is completely free of the branch it is stopped in middair. Spinning around you, everything is still, when you look back at the fountain, the water is stopped in place. It isn't frozen like ice, but stuck in the air, unmoving. The drops of water that splashed out from where the fountain hit the pool are suspended in place.

As you watch, the pool of the fountain begins to spin and the water emits a strange glowing light. The glow increases as the water changes to a shade of crystal blue. 

    With a sudden splash, the water falls back to the ground but as you look around, you are no longer next to the fountain where you threw the coin."
