    All around you is a mish-mash of cobbled stone and ancient forest, bustling with colorfully dressed people almost all in various kinds of robes and most wearing tall pointed hats.

    Buildings of all sorts weave in and around giant trees. Some trees so large, they grow completely around the buildings, their roots curling around the walls before diving into the earth.

    Little shops with peaked roofs, shingled in old wood. Stone towers spiraling into the canopy of leaves above you. Steeples jutting at impossible angles, some dangling over the rough stone pathway where people walk to and from shops. Little paths jut out between buildings and you can see even more little shops deeper into the forest.

    You find yourself in a large ornate town square with a massive fountain at its center. The water of the fountain defies gravity flowing in spirals up and down through the air, surrounding a two stone merfolk whose hands are clasped together at the center.

    The square is paved in stones of many shapes and colors and all around it are vibrant shops and stalls. Many stalls have chests and jars that rattle and shake of their own accord. One particularly loud stall seems to be covered from wheel to roof in plants that sing and sway to their own music.

    The shops themsevles are in building of all sizes. Some spiraling high into the air, with many chimneys jutting at odd angles out of them, while others are so small, they seem to barely fit their door between the buildings to either side. 

    Little cobbled streets and alleys wind between the buildings like spokes off the square showing hints of even more shops down them.

    The whole place is bustling with colorfully dressed people almost all in various kinds of robes and most wearing tall pointed hats.
